# Per-Save Screenshots

Per-save Screenshots makes it so that when you take a screenshot, it is placed into a folder within the game's Screenshots folder that corresponds to your saved game. No more melting pot of all your screenshots, letting you fidn the ones you want quicker and easier.

## Dependencies (none included)
- Any KSP version!

## Installation
### Option 1. CKAN (heavily recommended)
Open CKAN, search for "Per-Save Screenshots", click the checkbox to the left, and click the green checkmark on the top of the window.
### Option 2. Manual
To install, open the PerSaveScreenshots.zip file and merge the GameData folder inside it with your KSP install's GameData folder. I will not devote a lot of time to troubleshooting manual installs, if you run into trouble just use CKAN.
